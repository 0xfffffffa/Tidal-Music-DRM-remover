This allowed "interested parties" to download the encrypted music streams and decrypt them locally 

You could only do this if you had a paid for account so technically not really breaking the service (unless you then went on to share resultant decrypted flac files). 

Sharing this in 2024 as issue has long been closed and as a matter of historical context. 

No liability accepted
